# Dashboard Widgets


## What Is This?
The concept of a Dashboard appears nearly everywhere. Most obvious are car dashboards with displays of speed, mileage, and navigation. Less obvious examples are: the FaceBook banner with notifications, informational displays in lobbies, and “widgets” on iOS and Android. A portion of a larger display is a widget.
This Dashboard Widgets is created with the goal to motivate or inspire user with the background image transitions to different images with inspirational/motivational quotes, so it's not simply just having the date, time, weather info in a plain backround but actually serves a purpose of motivating users to do the things they want to do in order to be successful.
